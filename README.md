Break Through Tech AI is a Cornell Tech initiative that brings together college students in the greater Boston area interested in taking the first steps to enter the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) industry. It is a virtual, one-year extracurricular experience that equips students with the skills needed to secure a job in the fastest-growing areas of tech. Developed by industry and academic leaders, students master the skills necessary to become a successful machine learning engineer. This program is split into 3 sections: An ML Foundations course sponsored by Cornell, an industry project in the fall, and a Google Kaggle competition in the spring (hence, this very project).

AI is transforming healthcare, yet dermatology AI tools often underperform for people with darker skin tones due to a lack of diverse training data. This can lead to diagnostic errors, delayed treatments, and health disparities for underserved communities. To combat the diagnostic errors, the goal is to train a model that can, as accurately as possible, classify 21 different skin conditions across diverse skin tones, as denoted by the Fitzpatrick Scale.
